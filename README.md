# Youtube Video Trimmer - Supademo

## Description
This is a nextjs based react app that trims youtube videos. It used Youtube Iframe API to play the video.
The app is not using any third party library for trimming the video.

## Notes
* I had to define some types on my own for YouTube IFrame API as I wanted to avoid importing any third party library.
* It was tricky to pause video at trim end.

## If I had more time
* I would have added tests.
* I would have worked on accessibility.
* I would have created utility classes for some common styles.

## How to run
* Clone the repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev`
* Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser
