# YouTube Video Trimmer - Supademo

## Description
This is a **Next.js**-based **React** application that allows users to trim YouTube videos. It utilizes the **YouTube IFrame API** for video playback and does not rely on any third-party libraries for trimming functionality.

## Notes
- Custom TypeScript types were defined for the **YouTube IFrame API** to avoid importing external libraries.
- Implementing precise video pausing at the trim endpoint was a challenging aspect of development.

## Future Improvements
If given more time, I would:
- Add comprehensive tests.
- Improve accessibility for a better user experience.
- Create utility classes for reusable styles.
- Add loading spinners for loading player and list of videos.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
